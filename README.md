# School Management Project

Welcome to our School Management Project! This project integrates advanced technologies including Spring Boot 3, Spring Security 6, Angular 16, Angular Material UI, and a MySQL database.

## Project Highlights

### 1. Modular Architecture

Our School Management Project is divided into two distinct modules: Admin and Student. Each module has its routing system, ensuring a seamless and organized user experience.
